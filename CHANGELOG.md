## [dev-3.0] - Test GitHub Commit

### Added
- **Lucy's Week** now only displays the song **Infernus** if the player has already beaten the level.

### Changed
- Replaced all base intro texts with a couple of new ones.
- Replaced all instances of **"KeithDaBoi"** in credits to **"MintyMara"**

### Fixed
- The Main Menu version text now displays the correct version (dev-3.0 as of this update).

### Removed
- Removed **Meetup (Galaxy Mix)** from the freeplay menu (it will be added back at a later date).

## [dev-2.0] - 11-19-2025

### Added
- Added the original sprites for all characters that were in the original ***Funkin' (Keith T. Boi Ver.)*** mod.
- Gave **Meetup** better camera movements.
- **Infernus** now has ***Easy*** and ***Normal*** difficulties.
- The mod folder now has a proper **_polymod_icon** image.

### Fixed
- The mod no longer crashes the game due to an error in Boyfriend's "*ownedChars*" array having an extra comma.

### Removed
- Removed the memes from the "*videos*" folder, as they just result in longer load times.
- Removed all "*temple/template*" assets from the mod folder to improve performance.
