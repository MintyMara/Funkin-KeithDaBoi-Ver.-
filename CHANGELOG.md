## [dev-2.0] - 11-19-2025

### Added
- Added the original sprites for all characters that were in the original ***Funkin' (Keith T. Boi Ver.)*** mod.
- Gave **Meetup** better camera movements.
- **Infernus** now has ***Easy*** and ***Normal*** difficulties.
- The mod folder now has a proper **_polymod_icon** image.

### Fixed
- The mod no longer crashes the game due to an error in Boyfriend's "*ownedChars*" array having an extra comma.

### Removed
- Removed the memes from the "*videos*" folder, as they just result in longer load times.
- Removed all "*temple/template*" assets from the mod folder to improve performance.
